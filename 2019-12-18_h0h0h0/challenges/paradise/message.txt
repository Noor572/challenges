Jim,

Those pesky demons have been getting past the gates more and more
frequently. We need to do something about them otherwise the integrity
of paradise is going to be compromised. I know you have a good solution,
I'm counting on you, my son.

    -- God


Father,

I've created an ELF which will protect our dear paradise from the foul
demons. It will change the gate key every minute and protect us for
infinity to come. The ELF will accept three important parameters:

   In the first, an address to send the new holy key to.
   In the second, the name of the entity to protect.
   In the last, the magical value known as the epoch to mankind.

The ELF will then proclaim 12 magical glyphs that make up the secret
key to paradise.


The cradle is already ready, but you must deploy this ELF protector so
as to protect our precious paradise.

   -- Jim
