Hey, man, I need your help. I've been kicked out of paradise and would
like to get back in.  Unfortunately, the key changes every minute so I
can't make it back. I was able to steal a message from God to one of
his security consultants and I think it contains something that might
be helpful for you.

The gate is flag@montrehack.ca -p 14141

Here's the [message][msg].

If you help me get back into paradise, You will definitely go to
paradise too!
