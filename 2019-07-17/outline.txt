- Find `main` by using strings search
- Set a breakpoint in main on the level dispatcher

- Hit Continue and break on TLS callback
- Find suspicious calls to RegisterClassEx
- Identify WindowProc Address
- Identify DebugActiveProcess and CreateNamedPipe functionality in sub-routine
- Patch the real key (0x7001337) in place of the bogus key
- Patch the IsDebuggerPresent function to always return false (xor eax, eax; ret)
- Continue to entry point
- Continue to main breakpoint

- Level 1:
- Set a breakpoint right after the `Your flag is at 0x...` string is printed.
- Read flag in memory

- Continue to level 2
- Patch out the heap check so that the jump is taken unconditionally.
- Continue to flag

- Continue to level 3
- Patch out CreateThread,int3 and flatten path to `mov rdx, KEY`.
- Continue to flag

- Continue to level 4
- Go to the WndProc to identify the XOR key.
- XOR the SendMessage parameter and observe that it's a valid address.
- Go to the address and find the (same) XOR key for another function call.
- XOR the set_key function and patch the address.
- Step through to see the set_key being called.
- Continue to flag.

- Continue to level 5
- Flag Key is patched from TLS earlier.
- Continue to flag.
