1 - Decrypt private key from cfx bundle.  

openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pfx -nodes -out pcap3.pem

2 - In wireshark, in protocol/ssl, configure ssl by adding your decrypted key::

IP Address: 10.153.108.140
Port:       3389
Protocol:   tpkt
Key file:   pcap3.pem (must be exported private key file in step 1)

3 - Look for tlsv1 packets, expand, click on Secure Socket Layer, right click and select follow ssl stream.  

Note: Step 3 worked for me with wireshark 1.10.2 (kali) but not with wireshark 1.8.2 (debian wheezy)

4 - Follow ssl stream will open a new window.  Then, select packets from client to server and select hex dump format.  Export result to pcap3.keystrokes.

5 - In your pcap3.keytrokes files, you will be looking for lines like these:

000006CB  44 04 00 32                                      D..2 

000006CF  44 04 01 32                                      D..2 

Format goes like this:

44 04: Client is sending a keyboard related event

00 | 01: Third bytes set to 0 means key is pressed, set to 1 means key is released.  

Last byte is the scan code.  I've made a table which links scan codes to ascii caracters or known name of key (esc, enter, shift, ctrl, etc).  I used that table along with a python script to figure out key pressed by user during that rdp session.

Scan codes maps are to be found here

6 - I came up with the following python script to translate the scan codes from the hex dump we got from wireshark using the scancode table created in step 5

#!/usr/bin/env python
import collections

keys={}
def loadkscan(keys):
  """ load keyboard scancodes table from scancodes.csv """
  kscan=open('scancodes.csv', 'r')
  for line in kscan:
    key=line.split(',')
    keys[key[0]]=key[1:2]
  kscan.close()

loadkscan(keys)

keystrokes={}
pcap=open('pcap3.keystrokes','r')
for line in pcap:
  keystroke=line.split(' ')
  if (len(keystroke) >= 6): 
    if (int(keystroke[2] + keystroke[3],16) == 0x4404):
      keystrokes[keystroke[0]]=keystroke[4:6]
    


pcap.close()

odks=collections.OrderedDict(sorted(keystrokes.items()))

f=open('flag3.txt','w')
for k,v in odks.iteritems():
    if (int(v[0],10) % 2 == 0):
        f.write(str(keys[hex(int(v[1],16))])+"\n")
        
    
f.close()

7 - Open flag3.txt.  The flag is the inventor of Konami code, which should be Kazuhisa Hashimoto. Done!
