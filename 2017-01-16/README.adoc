== Malicious Network Traffic

You are an incident responder, you receive a Pcap from Operations saying that
this traffic was obtained from a C-level executive laptop. The executive is
about to leave for the day. Do you allow him to leave with his laptop or not?

For all level zip files:

* Is the affected computer infected or clean?
* If it is infected what is the malware family?
